### 3. World Bank Data EDA

**Python Version:** 3.9  

**Libraries Used:** Pandas, Numpy, World_bank_data, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

World_bank_data is a library that makes api calls to the world bank data bank so you can pull data from various indexes without having to download them.

The end goal of this project was to look at some global data provided by the world bank and produce some interactive choropleth maps using plotly.
I also set out to take the data and extract some useful information from it, producing some graphs

Since I found myself wanting to produce identical graphs for the data, I found this great practice for creating graphs with loops. Not all of them are visibly useful because of the scale of the data, but it was a great exercise regardless.

I am very happy with the produces choropleth maps

### 5. Ecommerce Dataset
[Link to kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/prachi13/customer-analytics)

**Python Version:** 3.9  

**Libraries Used:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Initially I set out with no specific goal in mind, I soon made it a point to practice using pandas built in graphing tools and putting labels on the graphs in addition to the standard, basic data exploration.

I think the graphs turned out nice, adding the value to the centre makes understanding the graph at a glance much easier.
